# up221-Hamzah
## Profile
Hi all, my name is Hamzah and I am a first-year MURP concentrating in Transportation Policy and Planning. I am originally from Singapore, where I grew up and went to public school, although my mother hails from Puerto Rico. We would regularly visit the US as a result. My dad is an indigineous Malay so we are native to the region. I did my undergraduate degree in Anthropology at Macalester College in St Paul, MN. After college, I moved back to Singapore and worked for a year at the Ministry of National Development and then another year at an urban think-tank. I didn't really enjoy my time working for the Singapore government so I left. In my free time, I enjoy cycling and working out. While I was living at home, I would often cycle across Singapore, exploring different parts of the island (it is a very small country). I also play squash, although I haven't played in a while, but I really enjoy how dynamic the game is. I also like to read and I try to read as widely as possible. I look forward to taking this class and learning how to code! 
## About this course
From my understanding, this course will help us learn how to visualize spatial data in a way that is critical and cognizant of the implications of doing so. In other words, it's not just about learning how to represent data but understanding the way it fits into the larger narrative about what we're trying to tell. 
## Project Ideas
I don't have a firm idea at the moment. But I am interested in the relationship between mobility and income disparity/racial inequities. I found some data on trips by mobility devices (e.g. e-scooters) for LA county. I was thinking of mapping this data against income/race. Apart from this, I'd also be interested in looking at air pollution and racial inequities or bus service and racial/income disparities. 
## Class Objectives
Learning how best to represent data spatially and gaining a better grip on how to code in python.

I don't have many pictures on me at the moment, but here's one of my trip to San Francisco over winter break!
